                <p>Rather than having your own payroll department, you can outsource your payroll responsibilities to a company that specialises in payroll services.</p>

            <p>The third-party provider will manage all aspects of your payroll process; however, in order for them to do so, you must provide them with information about your employees, such as the hours worked and the rate of pay for each pay period.</p>

            <p>It is up to you how much of the payroll process you outsource to a third party; completely outsourcing the process will include many of the functions, such as calculating gross wages, setting up a payroll system, and making any necessary national insurance deductions.</p>

            <p>They will be able to print and email payslips, as well as print and send them.</p>
            <p>They can deposit funds into your employees' bank accounts, enter any and all payroll data, prepare and submit tax filings for your employees, and complete and file any other necessary paperwork not listed, including  submissions to HMRC.</p>

                    <p>The advantages of outsourcing your payroll to a third party to manage your payroll services are numerous.</p>

                    <p>You will immediately notice a financial benefit; payroll companies can often save you money because you no longer need to hire someone, or a team of people, to perform the job.</p>

                    <p>There are additional savings to be made, such as any licencing fees for payroll software, any supplies and equipment, such as perforation machines, ink and paper, printers, and you will not have to pay for ongoing payroll training and development.</p>

                    <p>When you consider outsourcing your payroll to a third-party payroll provider, you will immediately see time and money savings for you and your company. This relieves your employees of the complex administrative duties associated with payroll, allowing them to concentrate on the actual business.</p>

                    <p>There will be additional benefits in terms of increased HMRC compliance and security because you will be outsourcing to an HMRC compliant payroll provider.</p>
                </div>

            <div class="col-lg-6">
                <div class="card p-5 icons-color-bg animate__animated wow animate__fadeInDownBig" >
                    <p>It will no longer be your responsibility as a business to keep up with legislative changes inÂ payroll, or to worry about meeting deadlines or ensuring compliance with any local, state, or federal laws in payroll, as this will be handled by a specialist payroll company.</p>

                    <p>Furthermore, because the payroll provider will be managing multiple accounts from various companies, they will ensure that they have cutting-edge encryption, firewalls, and other security devices to protect your and their clients' employees' data.</p>

                    <p>This reduces the risk of theft, security breaches, or fraud while also keeping any data confidential and secure.</p>

                    <p>Even if you hire a third party to process your company's payroll, you will still have oversight and control over the process.</p>

                    <p>You will have complete access and control over the process through reports, payroll software, and, most importantly, access to your payroll manager who can answer any of your questions or deal with any of your employees' questions.</p>

                <p>All we will need from you in the future is for you to notify us on each pay day how long each of your employees has actually worked.</p>
                <p>We then calculate their pay and show any tax and National Insurance deductions, which can then be paid to HMRC.</p>
                <p>It couldn't be simpler. </p>
                <p>All of this should relieve you of the burden of payroll, allowing you to focus on other aspects of your business.</p>
